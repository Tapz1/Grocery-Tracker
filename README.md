# Grocery-Tracker
This project uses C++ and python to read data in from a file and export out data from that file. You are presented options via a switch menu to run any of these three options: 
1) View all items that were sold from the grocery store and how many times each item was sold
2) View just one specific item but entering it in and seeing it's individual data on how often it was purchased
3) Read in the file and create a .dat file with the info to then display the data from the .dat file in the form of a text-based histogram
4) Exiting the program 

These options solve the problem of not being able to track which items sell the most or least. And allows the shop owner to better strategize on how to market their items and continue to promote which sell the most. 
I believe I did well with designing this application, especially since this was my first time fully designing one that integrates another language like this. But, I could have definitely done better with error-checking with the user-inputs. I managed to make my own method to check for the right choice options but after submitting the project, I found an issue when a user enters in a floating/double type number which is not likely to happen but it's still a possibility. 

I'd have to say, the most challenging parts of this application, for me, was the python integration. Using python's own brilliance on reading in data and sorting it, to then using C++'s methods to do something with it was super cool but at the same time really challenging. I found myself reviewing python dpocumentation constantly to refresh my memory. It also helped to write some of the code on my whiteboard to better visualize it. 

The skills I have learned in this application, from integrating Python to manipulating data and a clean interface using C++ are easily transferrable to future courses and any future work that I'll face. But to ensure that my code is maintainable, readable and adaptable, I made sure to include inline comments, use proper variable names and methods and left plenty of whitespace for indentation. Also not overusing the same code.
